In today’s edition of Cheeky News, 
Yet another single announced...

Welcome back to Cheeky News, today you’ll we’ll talk about an up and coming single from Cheeky J. News spread from insider specialists talking about a rumoured song. The initial information was the title, “Big Hippo” and the cover. There wasn’t really any other information. It wasn’t even certain if the song would come out at all. However, we are not at the initial information stage of the song. It is known that it is going to be a diss similar to “Taco Bell Diss” and “Hotdog Stand”. Based of a leak from the credits page of the music player, we know that the beat will be produced by a producer on youtube “Twenty 4”. The release date of the song is uncertain given the fact that “Hammock” is also in the works. Insider specialists tell us that there is a good chance “Big Hippo” comes out first despite being announced after “Hammock”. An even bigger question is, “Will these songs be a part of ‘Cheeky Boomin’ part 2?”. Even better, “When will ‘Cheeky Boomin’ part 2 drop?”. All this is unknown at the moment of writing. Perhaps it will be revealed in the coming weeks. There have also been rumors of a possible music video but they’re just rumors. Even the word “rumor” is a bit of an overstatement. Its but a thought, something to be considered. I would’ve made a few music videos by now if it wasn’t for the fact that I don’t own the beats. Enough chitter chatter, stay tuned for the next article of “Cheeky News”.
