In today’s edition of Cheeky News, 
Too many singles…

If you’ve read the last few articles you’re aware of the many rumoured singles. If you were hoping for another one, you’re in luck. Cheeky J has once again posted about an upcoming single. The caption for the post reads “Dropping another single soon” with a picture of the cover in the background. If you take a good look you can see the number 20 in said cover. It’s not too obvious what the rest of the text says. We can only wait until further leaks and rumors. Wait a minute… what about “Hammock”? It was rumoured even before “Big Hippo” and it’s safe to assume that it will be ignored once again in favor of the leaked single. Will Hammock even come out as a single? We already know that it’s going to be a song on “Cheeky Boomin Vol 2” at this point it might was well just come out with the album which by the way is rumoured to drop January 5 2024. Enough chitter chatter. I’ve leaked enough already. Stay tuned for more Cheeky News.
