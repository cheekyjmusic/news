What we know so far about cheeky boomin
Cheeky boomin is an album rumored to drop on August 10. Acording to the leaked album cover, it will be a collab album between Aldo, Derek, and Jorge. Derek has by far posted many more clues about the album than Jorge or Aldo. Derek's clues range from collaborations with spiderman to even fortnite. Sadly, fans from around the globe spotted small white text in the corner of the images reading "this collaboration is not real." On the other hand, Aldo has spoken very little about the album. Now that I think about it, I don't actually think hes made mention about the album. While the current tracklist or even status of the album are unknown, we hope that the album comes with many juicy songs.

Stay tuned for some more Cheeky News!
