In today’s edition of Cheeky News, 
The next single…

This just in: a new song has been announced for the upcoming album “Cheeky Boomin”! Cheeky J posted the following image with the caption, “Working on a new song”. It doesn’t take a forensic scientist to figure out that the image has the word “Hammock”. The release date for “Hammock” is still unknown, but the wait shouldn't be too long. So far we only know about two songs for part 2 of “Cheeky Boomin” those being “Omelette” and “Hammock”. Some major changes have been made to the music player website. To begin with, there is now a dedicated page to see all the singles I have released. You can access it by going to my page, scrolling down to where the singles are and clicking “See All”. Actually the biggest update which was been released so far is the recording of the entire main page. You probably won’t notice this as it doesn’t really affect the visuals. Another small change is that you can now play songs directly from the popular songs list. Going back to Hammock”, the maximum waiting time would be late October. Keep your eyes peeled for any updates, articles, or posts talking about the new single.
