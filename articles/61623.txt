Rubens feature
Ruben hopped on a remix with Jorge a few weeks back. The song came to be known as the "nike kicks remix". By no means was it a good song. Barely any would consider it a song at all. Due to this, the song was removed off all platforms along with its original counterpart "nike kicks" which was somehow even worse than the remix.

I haven't told Ruben that his song has been removed.

Stay tuned for some more Cheeky News!
