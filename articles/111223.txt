In today’s edition of Cheeky News, 
Cheeky Boomin Vol 2 songs leaked…

Welcome back to Cheeky News. In today’s article you will learn about the leaked songs from Cheeky Boomin Vol 2. Over the course of the last few weeks, Cheeky J has been giving hints of the new singles. Some may say too much hints. The first song to be leaked was “Supermarket Donut”. It has the same style as corner store twinkie. Not a whole lot of the song is shown though. The second one to get leaked is “Hotel 7”. We did get quite the beefy preview spanning about 3 verses. It amassed over 450 views in 1 week smashing all of Cheeky J’s previous records. This is epic. The preview got more views than all of my other songs combined. I sure do hope those streams carry on to the actual song. The release date is unknown. It's a 50/50 whether its going to come out as a single or come out with the album. By the way here is the link to my youtube channel {https://youtube.com/@CheekyJ}. Links are the new feature in Cheeky News. Anyways, stay tuned for more Cheeky News.
