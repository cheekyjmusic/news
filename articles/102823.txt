Cheeky Booming Vol 2

Welcome back to Cheeky News, today we'll discuss Cheeky Booming Vol 2. Everything from facts, rumours, and even hopes. In case you didn't already know, Cheeky Boomin is an album by Cheeky J released August 18, 2023. Cheeky Boomin Vol 2 is it's successor. Not a lot is known but we do know some things. It's rumoured to drop January 5 2024 and the cover is a blue, white, and black version of Cheeky Booming vol 1. The number of tracks isn't certain. It could be anywhere from 6 to 12. We do however know that "Omelette" and "Hammock" will be on Cheeky Boomin Vol 2. I hope that there will be at least 1 music video for the album like there was with Cheeky Boomin Vol 1. I wasn't joking when I said not a lot was known about Cheeky Boomin Vol 2. This has been it for today. Stay tuned for the next Cheeky News article.
