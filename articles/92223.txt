"Cheeky Boomin" Merchandise: Coming Soon and more 

I’m thrilled to announce the upcoming release of "Cheeky Boomin" merchandise, featuring a stylish t-shirt adorned with an image inspired by the track "Metro Station." In case you didn’t already notice, the train is emerging from a portal. If you look closely, you will see that the portal is taking the train from a city to this new realm. Enough talking about the image, let’s talk about the business. “Cheeky Boomin” is an album by me, “Cheeky J”. Development began somewhere around June 9th, 2023 with the track “Suburbs Freestyle,” whose remix was put in the album. A few days after creating the so called “Suburbs Freestyle,” I decided I try making an album. The next track I would work on came to be titled “Mr Clean,” featuring Princeton. The next two tracks I worked on for the album didn’t actually make the cut, those being “Nuclear Reactor” and “Dasani”. Who knows, they might make a comeback in Cheeky Boomin Part 2. There are parts where you can tell that “Mr Clean” came right after “Suburbs Freestyle”. At the start of “Mr Clean”, I mention Jason who if you didn’t know is basically the main character of the imaginary story for “Suburbs Freestyle”. The song lyrics was composed on the spot by Derek and I which explains the goofy nature of the song and why I repeated several lines. The music video was actually shot on the same day we recorded the song during a field trip to the local park. Cheeky Boomin has been quite the journey and you haven’t even heard half the story. Stay tuned for the next article where I will reveal even more backstory.
