Cheeky Boomin: The Backstory

Welcome back to my series of articles. Today you will be learning more about the backstory of “Cheeky Boomin”. After recording the music video for “Suburbs Freestyle,” I decided to make some more songs those being “Taco Bell Diss,” “Sumo Wrestler,” and “Corner Store Twinkie.” They were pretty short and had some basic beats. I decided to make Cheeky Boomin after these songs. As you learned about in the last article, “Mr. Clean” was the first song I worked on for “Cheeky Boomin.” Let's talk about some of the other songs. Starting with track number 1, “Cheeky Boomin,” the actual song is about the creation of the album, basically one of these articles made into a song. “Submarine” is kind of like “Sumo Wrestler” because its about someone eating a submarine. Hotdog stand is a diss but I couldn’t really finish it on time so it’s pretty short.  Then comes “Metro Station”, my personal favorite from the album. It is yet another diss with clever rhymes. The 5th song is “Suburbs Freestyle Remix”. The 6th song is “Mr Clean” with princeton. “Mr Clean” was originally a single with its own cover and everything. It was also going to be named “Chat GPT” hence the green cave in the cover.  I kind of kept the green vibe with the unreleased song “Nuclear Reactor”. That song couldn’t really make the cut do to the fact that I didn’t have enough time to finish. Thats kind of funny given the fact I started working on it in June and dropped it in August 18. I didn’t actually do that much during the months in between. I spent most of the last week working on it. I had to finish 6 songs in a week though so as you can imagine, some had to get cut out. To be honest, I didn’t really like “Nuclear Reactor” it had some decent lyrics but the beat I got wasn’t really that good. I probably won’t add it back in Cheeky Boomin Vol 2. Stay tuned for some more Cheeky News.
